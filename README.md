Java Spring Boot Assessment


●  	What did you like about this project?

I liked the challenge of a new date format database...really forced me to read up on how to implement everything multiple times and iterating until everything worked.

●  	What did you struggle with in this project?

I mainly struggled with getting the date format to work. Other than that, I had issues with getting my extra delete feature to work (adding event listener to all buttons did not work through JavaScript somehow...).

●  	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think this kind of marathon coding session is quite draining but I got into #Hackermode and bulldozed through.
